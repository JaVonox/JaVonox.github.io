<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<br><br>
Hey, my name is Jamie Gorman, I'm a software developer from Birmingham, England. I've been interested in software development since I was a child, starting with actionscript as my first language at the age of 12.
Nowadays, I prefer to use languages like C# and python, but I pride myself on my ability to work with any language. I Recently completed my bachelors degree in computer science, resulting in a first class honours and two additional awards.
In my free time, I like to make my own games and simulations, some of which are listed below!
<h1>Projects Overview</h1>
<h2>Juris-Civilis</h2>

<br><br>
Juris-Civilis set out with the goal to create a world history simulation - mapping the growth of nations, technology, religions and more. While the scope of the project started small,
it eventually evolved into a huge undertaking - taking the better part of a year to complete to my satisfaction. The software, written entirely in C# using the unity engine, is able to create randomly generated worlds, each with their own
climate which determine the future of the inhabitants of the world.

<h2>Tauresium</h2>

<br><br>
The namesake for this website, the tauresium project was an exploration into php and javascript - two languages I had been unfamiliar with at the start of development. Tauresium was intended as a multiplayer browser game - inwhich
up to five players could participate in building their own countries and conquering land - either as a cooperative endeavour or as a competitive battlefield. The nations under the control of the players - defined with custom names, colours,
and systems of government, were able to expand their territory by using different forms of influence - diplomatic, economic and military - each generated based on the form of governance and responses of players to different questions they would
recieve throughout the session.

<h2>:C</h2>
<img src="ColonCPreview.png" style="height:320px;width:480px;"/>
<br><br>
Without a doubt one of the most technically complex projects I've worked on - :c (pronounced colon c) is a simple interpreted language of my own design. The language, which supports a range of basic functions such as iterative and selective
functions, as well as the ability to define a custom function, is designed as a simple and lightweight language. The interpreter itself makes up less than 200kb, and uses simple text files as inputs. This project is arguably the easiest to set up
and run.

<h2>Bankbot</h2>

<br><br>
An exploration into machine learning and data analysis, Bankbot is a simple AI chatbot that categorises questions based on different tags relating to finance - providing an automated template response telling a user where to contact for answers
to their query. The AI uses a relatively small dataset (though it is built to accept and work with other datasets) composed of 500 stack overflow finance questions - downloaded using the stackoverflow API. A portion of these are then used as
training data, and some as testing data. When finished, the bot often reports around a 75% success rate on matching topics using the default method - though other algorithms can be enabled in the source code.
