The Tauresium project, named for the Macedonian archaeological site, is an online multiplayer map game. Taking control of a user-created country, the player competes against up to four other players for global dominance, using
so called "influence" points to expand and develop their nations. These influence points are subdivided into three categories: diplomatic, economic and military. 
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Diplomatic influence can only be used to acquire unowned adjacent provinces.</li>
<li>Economic influence is used to expand across nearby waters, allowing the conquest of unowned islands.</li>
<li>Military influence can be used to expand across both land and sea, as well as into territory owned by other players - however it is the most expensive method of land acquisition and a player is limited on how much military control they may hold at one time</li> 
</ul>
These influence points are generated by answering multiple choice questions, to which a player is allowed to answer a certain amount per day. Making multiple choices of the same type over a period of time slowly modifies how much influence
a player can gain in each influence category, at the cost of lowering the generation speed of other influence categories. Through this mechanism, the player is incentivised to make decisions based on the world aroung them - a player finding themselves in indonesia or
any similar archipelagic region should prioritise economic influence, whereas a player in close contact with other players should prioritise militaristic choices.
<br><br>
In addition to this, each province on the map has a distinct value for each of the three categories, determining how many influence points must be spent to claim ownership of the region - said values representing the current status of the region in the modern day. 
The diplomatic cost of a region is calculated using the regional population and national human development index scores, whereas the economic value of the region uses the national gross domestic product and human development index, with military using a combination of both.
In practice,this modifies the way a player interacts with the world around them, with players in less developed regions able to quickly amass more land with lower value, whereas a player in a developed region will expand slower but with better gains.
<br><br>
Finally, acquired provinces can be upgraded using the buildings system - inwhich a nation is permitted to construct a series of buildings in line with their two most valuable categories. These buildings expand aspects like the cost of a region to take militarily, as well as
more passive impacts like lowering the cost of other buildings. This allows players to choose between playing wide - taking large swathes of land to fuel their nation - or tall - taking small amounts of land but developing said region to provide greater benefits for the nation as a whole.
<br><br>
Overall, this project is one of my personal favourites, as surpassed all its initial goals and became a genuinely enjoyable game. While not the most technically challenging to produce, it represented a step into unknown territory for me, php and backend web development as a whole - and the end result became a genuinely
enjoyable product. While I am unable to host the game online due to monetary constraints, the github link provided contains all the required files to launch an instance of the website - only requiring a web server to use - however, another way to see the game in action is by watching the provided demonstration
video attached below.
