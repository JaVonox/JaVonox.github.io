Pumpkin Panic was a 2019 gamejam project where two players fought to survive against an endless onslaught of evil jack o lanterns. A player may win by collecting
50 coins, dropped by the pumpkins as they are slain with the players scythes - or alternatively, a player can simply attempt to outlive their opponent. Each player begins the
game with 50 "lives" - representing a single hit by a pumpkin, and without any means for a player to restore lives, they must play carefully as to not give their opponent an
easy victory.
<br><br>
Pumpkin Panic was developed entirely in unity, with the entire game, assets included, developed by a small team within 48 hours.  

<br><br>
Unfortunately, the repository for the project is private at the request of one of the team members, and therefore the source code nor download can be shared.
